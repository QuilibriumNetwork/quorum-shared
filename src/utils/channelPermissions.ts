/**
 * Consolidated Channel Permission System
 *
 * This system handles all permission checks with a clear hierarchy and supports
 * isolated read-only channel permissions separate from regular role system.
 *
 * PERMISSION HIERARCHY:
 * 1. Space Owner - Has ALL permissions everywhere (inherent privilege)
 * 2. Own Messages - Users can always manage their own messages
 * 3. Read-Only Channel Managers - Have ALL permissions in their managed channels ONLY
 * 4. Traditional Roles - Have permissions in regular channels based on role assignments
 *
 * KEY PRINCIPLE: Read-only channels are completely isolated from traditional role system.
 * Users with traditional roles have NO permissions in read-only channels unless they are managers.
